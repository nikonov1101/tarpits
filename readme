At the moment of publishing this repo (20 aug 2024),
this code runs on 2 of my DigitalOcean's machines
for about 3 days, and what I've got:

* trapped about 25k connections,
* about 2Gb of meaningless traffic sent,
* got 234 *simultaneous* ssh connections to a single machine,
* the longest connection was open for about 3 hours.
